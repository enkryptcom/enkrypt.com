This rewards system is based on the usage of gas and interaction with any smart contract on the network, with rewards in the form of FXTL points that may then be converted into tokens. For the first time in blockchain technology, users can earn more rewards than the gas they spend, while developers can earn more than the gas their dApps consume.
